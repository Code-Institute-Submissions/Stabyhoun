# Stabyhoun
This website was created for all the people that are thinking about getting a dog, but don't know which breed they are going to get.
These people can get a first impression about the stabyhoun through the pictures and given information.
By getting people enthousiastic for the breed, it can help to maintain the breed. 
The Stabyhoun is a breed from Dutch origin and at the moment there are around 2000 bitches, so it's importent to invest in maintaining this breed.
The website also provides in a few links for people that are happy with the first impression of this breed.
With these links they can get further info and, most importantly, they can find out where to buy a puppy. 
## UX
### User stories
As a potential dog buyer, I want to do a first orientation on the Stabyhoun.
By looking through the pictures and information, I will be able to get a first impression and I can see if I think this breed would suit my lifestyle
By reading the info section I will be able to find out if the characteristics of this dog will fit my wishes, and if I can give this type of dog what it needs.
If the first impression is good, I want to know where I can get more profound information, to be able to make the right decision.
This website helps me with this by providing in some links.
I also want to know where I can eventually buy a puppy when I've made my decission to buy a dog from this breed.
I will be able to find these adresses by following the links to the websites of the Dutch associations for the Stabyhoun.
If I have any questions regarding the website, I want to know how I can contact the owner of the website.
I can do that by using the contact page.
### Design

It provides insight in how I wanted my homepage and info section to look on a desktop, mobile and tablet.
The most important thing for me was to have an eye catching home section.
This way a potential dog buyer would fall in love with the breed right away.
## Features
In this project I added the following features:
* A navigation menu, which changes to a hamburger menu on smaller screens
* On smaller screens the paw icon in the header disappears, so it doesn't interfere with the hamburger icon
* When you have the hamburger menu on smaller screens, you get a dropdown menu when clicking the hamburger icon
* When te navigation menu is on full-size, you can see witch section of the page you're currently on
* I made a one page scroller that scrolls slowely to the right section when clicked on
* I've used a hero-image with jumbotron that catches the eye when opening the website
* I've added links to external websites and Facebook pages when clicked to redirect the user to another website with more information on certain subjects
* I've added in a paw and facebook icon from font awesome to get a nice look
* I've used the grid system from Bootstrap in the info-section to get this section to be responsive on different devices
* I've added in a form to contact the owner of the website
## Features left to Implement
When spending more time on this project, I would like to include the following features:
* Slowely scrolling to the right section when clicked on for browsers other then Google Chrome
* Make the brand logo more responsive so it would be smaller on smaller screens to get the paw icon to fit the header
* Make the header more responsive so the height would adjust to the smaller brand logo on smaller screens
